        <h3>ServiceChannel</h3>
        <div class="servicechannel_logo"></div>
        <p>ServiceChannel was founded in 1999 and is currently in use by leading national facility managers in the retail, restaurant, commercial and industrial sectors to manage data for more than 40,000 locations. Over 10,000 service contractors have been trained on ServiceChannel to date with more using the system each day.</p>
        <p>We believe that ServiceChannel’s industry leadership is a result of four main differentiators:</p>
        <p>First, we are completely independent and we are not a contractor or an outsourcer - we empower our clients with technology to collaborate with their own contractors and find new ones by connecting with other ServiceChannel clients.</p>
        <p>Second, ServiceChannel is flexible, working with facility management departments and contractors’ existing processes as well as their current asset, lease management and accounting systems to deliver real value without lengthy or costly implementations.</p>
        <p>Third, we are entirely focused on a single industry. Every member of our team has a deep understanding of the challenges that facility managers and contractors face every day and as a result, our solutions are actionable and impactful. It is important to note that ServiceChannel owns and develops all of its own technology, giving us the ability to continually develop and improve our platform to better meet the changing needs of our clients.</p>
        <p>Fourth, we are the leaders in the industry and have a proven solution that is in use by more major retailers, restaurants, other commercial property managers than any other. As a result, engaging ServiceChannel represents an exceptionally low risk and high impact solution for our clients.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Fixxbook</h3>
        <div class="fixxbook_logo"></div>
